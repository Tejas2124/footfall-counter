here is the notebook for DeepSORT 
using this notebook you can perform the same operation as app, but it will be more accuracte as well as heavy
you need GPU's like P100 and so on, for running the algorithm smooth,


for Kaggle 

create a dataset for yourpersonal
add video to it,
add the dataset inside the kaggle workspace environment
use the video path for the input 
run the cells 
at the end you will get the processed video inside the output.
Download the video , 
For the cordinates use the same video using the streamlit and get the cordinates from the app.
use the cordinates inside the notebook.the line will be set by it.
